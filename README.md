# Scaler DSML Product Sales Forecasting

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for multi-model, multi-entity sales and orders forecasting, built as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning (DSML) project for Scaler. It features an interactive Streamlit app, robust forecasting pipelines, and a detailed analysis of sales data across a company and its regions.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Forecast sales (and optionally, orders) for a company and its four regions using multiple time series models.

- **Models Implemented:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - XGBoost  
  - ARIMA  
  - SARIMAX  
  - Prophet
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports both company-level and region-level forecasts.
  - Handles exogenous features: holidays & discounts
  - Model selection and forecast horizon are user-configurable.
  - Displays model accuracy (MAPE) for all segments/models.
  - Downloadable forecast results.
  - Intuitive Streamlit user interface.

## Data

- **Training Data:** Sales, orders, and exogenous information for the company and each region.
- **Inference Data:** Future period data (e.g., Juneâ€“July 2019) for forecasting.
- **Features Used:**  
  - Sales, Orders  
  - Holiday flags  
  - Discounted Stores  
  - Time-based features

## Model Development & Evaluation

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  - Data Aggregation, anomaly detection, time series analysis were performed for each entity.
  - Feature engineering included time-based and cyclical encodings to enhance model performance.
 

- **Modeling:**  
  - Multiple models were trained, tuned, and evaluated using a 61-day holdout set.
  - MAPE was used as the primary evaluation metric.
  - Model hyperparameters that resulted in best MAPEs were determined through grid search during training and analysis. These optimal hyperparameters were then used for real time forecasts generated by the app in order to reduce the processing time.  
 
    
- **Results:**  
  - All models Test MAPEs are displayed in the app to .
  - Orders forecasts are flagged as "untested"â€”their displayed MAPE comes from the corresponding Sales forecast.
