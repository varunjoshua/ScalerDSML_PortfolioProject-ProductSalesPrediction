# Scaler DSML Product Sales Forecasting

This repository is an attempt to build a multi-model, multi-entity sales and orders forecasting, built as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning (DSML) project for Scaler. It features an interactive Streamlit app, forecasting pipelines, and an analysis of sales data across a company and its regions.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Forecast sales (and optionally, orders) for a company and its four regions using multiple time series models.

- **Models Implemented:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - XGBoost  
  - ARIMA  
  - SARIMAX  
  - Prophet
 
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports both company-level and region-level forecasts.
  - Handles exogenous features: holidays & discounts
  - Model selection and forecast horizon are user selected.
  - Displays model accuracy (MAPE) for all segments/models for Sales forecasts.
  - Downloadable forecast results.
  - Intuitive Streamlit user interface.

## Data

The raw data contained daily Sales and Orders records of 365 stores for the period from 2018-01-01 to 2019-05-31 i.e. 516 days. The Data was group and aggregated to build pipelines to forecast sales at the company and region levels.  

- **Training Data:** Sales, orders, and exogenous information for the company and each region.
- **Inference Data:** Future period data (e.g., June–July 2019) for forecasting.
- **Features Used:**  
  - Sales, Orders  
  - Holiday flags  
  - Discounted Stores  
  - Engineered Time-based features

## Model Development & Evaluation

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  - Data Aggregation, anomaly detection, time series analysis were performed for each entity.
  - Feature engineering included time-based and cyclical encodings to enhance model performance.
 

- **Modeling:**  
  - Multiple models were trained, tuned, and evaluated using a 61-day holdout set.
  - MAPE was used as the primary evaluation metric.
  - Model hyperparameters that resulted in best MAPEs were determined through grid search during training and analysis. These optimal hyperparameters were then used for real time forecasts generated by the app in order to reduce the processing time.  
 
    
- **Results:**  
  - All models Test MAPEs are displayed in the app to .
  - Orders forecasts are flagged as "untested"—their displayed MAPE comes from the corresponding Sales forecast.

## Next Version
- Functions and pipelines will be updated to forecast Sales and Orders at the store level.
